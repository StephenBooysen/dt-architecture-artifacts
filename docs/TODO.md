# Features
- Use #cache to store folders


In the ui folder I would like you to create a simple express web application that listens of port 4000 that hosts   │
│   static htmls and css. please create a simple yet profession home page that will be a directory to the folders in    │
│   the public folder. These folders will be high definiton mockups for potential screens that the knowledge managment  │
│   screeen will have for the various business soltuions within our enterprise. These screens will be the business      │
│   solution and a summary of what it does and its lifecycle (Planned, live, reiring, retired) and its ownership from   │
│   a business, IT, Architeture, Delivery perspective. Then the seconds perspective would be from capability and value  │
│   stream perpsective e.g. the solution exposes digital commerce merchandising or digital commerce customer            │
│   capability and whether it is the master or just facilitation perspective. The next view point would be what data    │
│   types are orginated or required in the solution e.g. it could the the originator of digital commerce orders but is  │
│   the reader location information e.g. distribution warehouse as this actually originates from the wharehouse ERP.    │
│   The next viewpoint would be how the business solution/platform adheres to certain principles e.g.Mobile first,      │
│   leverages modern cloud platforms. The next viewpoint that I would like to have is a context viewpoint that shows    │
│   what platforms this platorm communicates with, what the interfaces are e.g. pricing, range , products, and the      │
│   middleware used e.g. API gateways, FTP, queues, streaming. The next viewpoint would be a techology viewpoint so     │
│   what technologues e.g. database mysql vs 12.1 or Kafka vs 12 various modules e.g. Frontend / backend the            │
│   busisiness soltuion uses and the status of those technology components e.g. out of support.
