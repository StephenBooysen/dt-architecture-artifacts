# Spaces Feature

## Feature Summary
All API calls retrieving markdown files, PDFs, and other file types were failing due to inconsistent Express route parameter handling introduced in recent commits.

## Prevention Measures

### Best Practices for Future Changes
1. **Route Syntax Consistency**: Always use standard Express route patterns for the version in use
2. **Parameter Access Standardization**: Use consistent parameter access patterns across all routes
3. **Testing**: Test API endpoints after route changes to catch breaking changes early
4. **Documentation**: Document route patterns and parameter access methods

### Recommended Testing Protocol
When making route changes:
1. Test basic API endpoints with curl/Postman
2. Verify file retrieval for different file types
3. Check both web client and desktop client functionality
4. Ensure browser extensions can still connect to API

## Files Modified
- `/server/src/routes/index.js` - Fixed 12 route patterns and parameter access

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: High - Affects all file operations across web, desktop, and browser extension clients
- **Risk**: Low - Fix restores existing functionality without changing API behavior
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained - API endpoints remain the same, only internal routing fixed

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - All file retrieval API calls now work correctly across all client applications.
