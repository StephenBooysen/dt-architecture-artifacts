# Spaces Feature

The "Spaces" server, not services, feature allows a user of the client to switch between spacees which contain different content. How this is configured is by using different filing providers or filing configurations. On the server please create a setting object for "Spaces". The spaces object stored in spaces.json should be something like this:
[
  {
    "space": "Pesonal",
    "access" : "write"
    "filing" : {
        "type" : "local"
        "localFolder" : "./content"
    }
  },
  {
    "space": "Shared",
    "access" : "write"
    "filing" : {
        "type" : "git"
        "localFolder" : "./content-shared",
        "git" : "https://github.com/StephenBooysen/dt-architecture-artifacts-shared.git"
        "git-branch": "main"
        "git-fetch-interval" : "5000"
    }
  },
  {
    "space": "Enterpise",
    "access" : "readonly"
    "filing" : {
        "type" : "git"
        "localFolder" : "./content-readonly",
        "git" : "https://github.com/StephenBooysen/dt-architecture-artifacts-readonly.git"
        "git-branch": "main"
        "git-fetch-interval" : "5000"
    }
  }
]
Please create a screen in the backed and a menu item on the left nav called "Spaces" that allows a backend user to edit and create spaces. The fields that should be editable are Space, where he space name is added, access which can be write or readonly and finally a json field for configuring the filer configuration. Please make it work like you did with the services screens e.g. caching where you show and example and validate the json before the user can save. And now is the complex part. On the client, below the files, the user should be able to select a space. The spaces available to the user should be stored in a new field in the users.json called spaces which holds a comma delimted field of allowed spaces. Please update the user edit screen to allow the backend user to select this. So what you need to do is create a new api on the server that brings back the allowed spaces for the client user to switch too. Now when the user switches to a new space , all the apis that manage content and templates needs to get a new url variable that contains the space to access e.g. /api/{space}/files. So now when an api call to search, upload, read files needs to then first look at the selected space in the spaces.json object then load and configure the filer before doing the server file operation ... this replaces the manual selection of filing provie we have now in the route\index.js. Thing very hard about this. It is going to be awesome. 

Can we try one more thing, in the client, can you move the spaces selection to the bottom of the navigation tree, Please make it look like the rest of the items on the navigation. So make a heading like "Files" calling it "Spaces". Then list the available spaces as links. The when you click on the space, it changes the space and highlights the link.



## Feature Summary
All API calls retrieving markdown files, PDFs, and other file types were failing due to inconsistent Express route parameter handling introduced in recent commits.

## Prevention Measures

### Best Practices for Future Changes
1. **Route Syntax Consistency**: Always use standard Express route patterns for the version in use
2. **Parameter Access Standardization**: Use consistent parameter access patterns across all routes
3. **Testing**: Test API endpoints after route changes to catch breaking changes early
4. **Documentation**: Document route patterns and parameter access methods

### Recommended Testing Protocol
When making route changes:
1. Test basic API endpoints with curl/Postman
2. Verify file retrieval for different file types
3. Check both web client and desktop client functionality
4. Ensure browser extensions can still connect to API

## Files Modified
- `/server/src/routes/index.js` - Fixed 12 route patterns and parameter access

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: High - Affects all file operations across web, desktop, and browser extension clients
- **Risk**: Low - Fix restores existing functionality without changing API behavior
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained - API endpoints remain the same, only internal routing fixed

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - All file retrieval API calls now work correctly across all client applications.
