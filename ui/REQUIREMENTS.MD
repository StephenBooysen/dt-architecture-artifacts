From IT executive perspective, what information would they want to see from an IT knowledge repository. And how would this be laid out from a overall subjects perspective and how do you think they would drill down or navigate the information?

Edit
Looking at this from an IT executive perspective, they need strategic oversight and decision-making capabilities rather than operational details. Here's how I believe they would want to consume this information:

IT Executive Information Hierarchy
Top-Level Executive Dashboard
IT executives would want to start with a high-level "health check" view:

Strategic Overview

Technology portfolio health score
Initiative delivery status (on-time, budget, scope)
Risk exposure summary (security, compliance, technical debt)
Investment allocation by business capability
Vendor concentration and dependency risks
Financial Perspective

Technology spend by category (infrastructure, applications, initiatives)
ROI metrics for major initiatives
License optimization opportunities
Technical debt cost implications
Budget variance tracking
Navigation & Drill-Down Patterns
1. Portfolio Management View
Starting Point: Application portfolio heat map

Axes: Business criticality vs. technical health
Drill-down: Click application → view dependencies, costs, initiatives affecting it
Action Items: Applications in "high risk" quadrants flagged for executive attention
2. Strategic Initiative Tracking
Starting Point: Initiative portfolio dashboard

Grouping: By strategic theme or business capability
Drill-down: Initiative → detailed timeline → impacted systems → resource allocation → risks/blockers
Executive Focus: Initiatives at risk, resource conflicts, strategic alignment
3. Risk & Compliance Management
Starting Point: Risk heat map by category

Categories: Security, compliance, technical, vendor, financial
Drill-down: Risk category → specific risks → affected systems → mitigation plans → ownership
Escalation Path: Risks requiring executive decision or board notification
4. Business Capability Coverage
Starting Point: Business capability maturity matrix

View: Capabilities mapped against strategic importance vs. current maturity
Drill-down: Capability → supporting applications → current initiatives → investment levels
Strategic Questions: "Where are we under-investing?" "What capabilities need strengthening?"

The key insight is that IT executives want to manage by exception - they need to quickly identify what requires their attention, understand the business impact, and have clear paths to detailed information when needed. The platform should surface problems and opportunities, not just data.




From a Delivery Manager Perspective, what information would be important for them and how do you think they would want to navigate and drill down into the data

Edit
From a Delivery Manager perspective, the focus shifts dramatically from strategic oversight to execution excellence and delivery orchestration. Here's how they would want to consume and navigate this information:

Delivery Manager Information Priorities
Primary Concerns
Delivery Risk Management: What could derail my projects?
Resource Optimization: Do I have the right people and dependencies aligned?
Timeline Coordination: How do my deliveries impact and depend on others?
Quality Assurance: Are we building the right thing the right way?
Stakeholder Communication: What do I need to report up/across?

Mobile-First Considerations
Delivery Managers are often mobile and need:

Quick Status Checks: Traffic light dashboards
Action Items: What needs my attention right now?
Contact Directory: Quick access to team members and stakeholders
Approval Workflows: Ability to approve/escalate from mobile device
Integration with Delivery Tools
The platform should provide contextual bridges to operational tools:

Jira Integration: Jump to specific tickets/epics
Confluence Integration: Access project documentation
Slack/Teams Integration: Communicate with teams
Calendar Integration: Schedule dependency resolution meetings
Critical Success Factors for Delivery Manager Adoption
Real-Time Accuracy: Information must be current enough to make decisions Actionable Intelligence: Every data point should suggest a specific action Context Preservation: Understanding the "why" behind current state Escalation Pathways: Clear routes to resolve blockers and issues Team Coordination: Tools that help orchestrate across multiple teams

The key insight is that Delivery Managers need operational intelligence that helps them coordinate, communicate, and course-correct in real-time. They're the conductors of the delivery orchestra, so they need visibility into every section while maintaining the overall rhythm and harmony of delivery.




What would Product Owner / Manager want to know about a Technical Knowledge repository and how would navigate drill down to the detail

Edit
From a Product Owner/Manager perspective, the focus shifts to product value delivery, customer impact, and business outcome optimization. Here's how they would want to consume and navigate this technical knowledge:

Product Owner/Manager Information Priorities
Primary Concerns
Business Value Delivery: How does the technical landscape enable/constrain product goals?

Business Impact: "What's the revenue/cost/efficiency impact?"
Market Position: "How does this affect our competitive advantage?"
User Experience: "How does this improve the product experience?"
Technical Translation Layer
The platform needs to translate technical complexity into product language:

Product Owner Workflow Integration
The platform should integrate seamlessly with product management workflows:

User Story Enrichment: Technical context for backlog items
Epic Planning: Technical feasibility assessment for large initiatives
Release Planning: Technical milestone mapping to product milestones
Retrospectives: Technical insights for product process improvement
The key insight is that Product Owners need the technical knowledge repository to be a business intelligence tool that helps them make better product decisions by understanding how technology enables or constrains their product vision. They need technical complexity translated into product impact, and they need data that helps them optimize for customer value delivery.




And finally a Software engineer, what do we think an engineer is looking for in a technical knowledge repository and would they navigate and drill down into the data

Edit
From a Software Engineer perspective, the focus shifts to implementation details, technical feasibility, and code-level decision making. Here's how they would want to consume and navigate this technical knowledge:

Software Engineer Information Priorities
Primary Concerns
Implementation Guidance: How do I actually build this?
Technical Dependencies: What do I need to integrate with and how?
Code Quality & Standards: What are the established patterns and practices?

"What's the approved way to handle database migrations?"
"Where can I find the schema for customer events?"
"What monitoring should I add for this API?"
Example-Driven Learning

Emergency Procedures: How to handle production issues
Critical Success Factors for Engineer Adoption
Accuracy & Currency: Information must be correct and up-to-date Searchability: Must be able to quickly find specific technical information Examples & Patterns: Concrete code examples and proven patterns Integration: Seamless integration with development tools and workflows Community: Platform for knowledge sharing and collaborative improvement

Engineer Feedback Loop
Knowledge Improvement Cycle
├── Usage Analytics (what's searched, what's missing)
├── Contribution Mechanisms (easy ways to add/update content)
├── Quality Feedback (what works, what doesn't)
└── Continuous Improvement (regular updates and refinements)
The key insight is that Software Engineers need the technical knowledge repository to be a practical implementation guide that helps them write better code faster. They need concrete examples, proven patterns, and contextual guidance that integrates seamlessly into their development workflow. The platform should reduce cognitive load by providing just-in-time information that helps them make good technical decisions without having to context-switch extensively.
